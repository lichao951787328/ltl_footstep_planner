# MIQCQP Footstep Planner with Encoded Linear Temporal Logic Specifications
## Abstract
This research presents an approach to encode Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) Specifications into a Mixed Integer Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (MIQCQP) footstep planner. We propose that the integration of LTL specifications into the planner not only facilitates safe and desirable locomotion between obstacle-free regions, but also provides a rich language for high-level reasoning in contact planning. Simulations of the footstep planner in a 2D environment satisfying encoded LTL specifications demonstrate the results of this research.
